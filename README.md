DrChex is basically a simple application powered by Pytorch and on top of that fastai. It is to recognize (/predict) chest x-rays with PNEUMONIA infection.  
The jupyter notebook [DrChex_model.ipynb](https://github.com/mohsen-saki/DrChex/blob/main/DrChex_model.ipynb) can be viewed as a tutorial eg. the main code for developing the model.
