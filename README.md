DrChex is basically a simple application powered by Pytorch and on top of that fastai. It is to recognize (/predict) chest x-rays with PNEUMONIA infection.  
The jupyter notebook [DrChex_model.ipynb](https://github.com/mohsen-saki/DrChex/blob/main/DrChex_model.ipynb) can be viewed as a tutorial eg. the main code for developing the model.  

### How To
* To open the notebook in Colab click [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mohsen-saki/DrChex/blob/main/DrChex_model.ipynb)
* Before running in Colab:
1. Download / upload xray image-set (from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)) into your project folder on gdrive
2. Modify pathes to the project folder and xray images in jupyter notebook
* To try prototype app in mybinder click [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mohsen-saki/DrChex/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2FDrChex_app.ipynb)
